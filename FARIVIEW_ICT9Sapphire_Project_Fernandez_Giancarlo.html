		<td> Never leave your kitchen unattended whilst cooking. </td>
		<td> It only takes a few seconds for a fire to break out. If you need to leave the kitchen for any reason whatsoever, make sure to either ask someone to watch the food for you or turn everything off altogether until youâ€™re back.</td>

		<td> Inspect your heating sources. </td>
		<td> House fires may very well be triggered if your home heating sources are not working properly. Be sure to always clean out your air conditioning filters, keep your heaters away from anything that is flammable, and have these things checked out by a professional once a year. </td>

		<td> Store any flammable products correctly. </td>
		<td> Household cleaners and items such as hair spray or shaving cream may be very hazardous if exposed to a strong source of heat. Always store these safely in a cool area away from any heaters. </td>

	<tr>
		<td> <img src="sher.jpg" width="300" height="300"> </td>
		<td> Keep a fire extinguisher or blanket around at all times! </td>
		<td> Fire extinguishers and blankets will be your best defence in the event of a fire breaking out. Every family member should know how to use a fire extinguisher, so in case something in your home does catch fire, it can be put out as fast as possible. Fire blankets are also very useful for putting out small fires before they become something larger and fiercer.</td>
